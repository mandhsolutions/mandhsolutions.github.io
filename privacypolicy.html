                        <b>Mandh Solutions</b> (the “Company”) is committed to protecting the privacy of its users.
                        This
                        Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand what information we
                        gather, how we use it, what we do to protect it, and to assist you in making informed
                        decisions when using our Service. Unless otherwise indicated below, this Privacy Policy
                        applies to any website that references this Privacy Policy, any Company website, as well as
                        any data the Company may collect across partnered and unaffiliated sites. <br>

                        For purposes of this Agreement, “Service” refers to the Company’s service which can be
                        accessed via our website at www.mandhsolutions.com or through our mobile application. The
                        terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Company. “You” refers to you, as a user of
                        Service.<br><br>

                        <b>I. CONSENT</b><br>

                        By accessing our Service, you accept our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use, and you consent
                        to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in
                        this Privacy Policy. In addition, by using our Service, or services across partnered and
                        unaffiliated sites, you are accepting the policies and practices described in this Privacy
                        Policy. Each time you visit our website, or use the Service, and any time you voluntarily
                        provide us with information, you agree that you are consenting to our collection, use and
                        disclosure of the information that you provide, and you are consenting to receive emails or
                        otherwise be contacted, as described in this Privacy Policy. Whether or not you register or
                        create any kind of account with us, this Privacy Policy applies to all users of the website
                        and the Service.<br><br>

                        <b>II. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</b><br>

                        We may collect both “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information” about you.
                        “Non-Personal Information” includes information that cannot be used to personally identify
                        you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect,
                        referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that
                        are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks. “Personal Information”
                        includes information that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name,
                        address and email address.<br>

                        In addition, we may also track information provided to us by your browser or by our mobile
                        application when you view or use the Service, such as the website you came from (known as
                        the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to
                        the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally
                        identify you. We use this information for, among other things, the operation of the
                        Service, to maintain the quality of the Service, to provide general statistics regarding
                        use of the Service and for other business purposes. We track this information using
                        cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent
                        to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive.
                        Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal Information about
                        that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both on
                        an individual and aggregate basis. The Company may use both persistent and session cookies;
                        persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you
                        delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies
                        can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to
                        disable cookies, some areas of the Service may not work properly.<br><br>

                        <b>III. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION</b><br>

                        Personal Information:<br>

                        In general, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share your Personal Information with
                        third parties without your consent. We may share your Personal Information with vendors and
                        other third-party providers who are performing services for the Company. In general, the
                        vendors and third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your
                        information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide for
                        the Company. For example, when you provide us with personal information to complete a
                        transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery, or return a
                        purchase, you consent to our collecting and using such personal information for that
                        specific purpose, including by transmitting such information to our vendors (and their
                        service providers) performing these services for the Company.<br>

                        However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment processors, have their own
                        privacy policies in respect of the information that we are required to provide to them in
                        order to use their services. For these third-party service providers, we recommend that you
                        read their privacy policies so that you can understand the manner in which your Personal
                        Information will be handled by such providers.<br><br>

                        In addition, we may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or if
                        you violate our Terms of Use.<br><br>

                        Non-Personal Information:<br>

                        In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customize
                        the user experience. We also aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends
                        and analyze use patterns of the Service. This Privacy Policy does not limit in any way our
                        use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose
                        such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our
                        sole discretion.<br><br>

                        <b>IV. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION</b><br>

                        We implement reasonable precautions and follow industry best practices in order to protect
                        your Personal Information and ensure that such Personal Information is not accessed,
                        disclosed, altered or destroyed. However, these measures do not guarantee that your
                        information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such
                        precautions. By using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume
                        these risks.<br><br>

                        V. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION<br>

                        You have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing purposes.
                        When we send a promotional communication to a user via Weebly, the user can opt out of
                        further promotional communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in
                        each promotional e-mail. Please note that notwithstanding the promotional preferences you
                        indicate by either unsubscribing or opting out in the Settings section of the Site, we may
                        continue to send you administrative emails including, for example, periodic updates to our
                        Privacy Policy.<br><br>

                        <b>VI. WEEBLY</b><br>

                        Our Service is hosted by Weebly, Inc. (“Weebly”). Weebly provides us with the online
                        e-commerce platform that allows us to provide the Service to you. Your information,
                        including Personal Information, may be stored through Weebly’s servers. By using the
                        Service, you consent to Weebly’s collection, disclosure, storage, and use of your Personal
                        Information in accordance with Weebly’s privacy policy available at
                        https://www.weebly.com/privacy.<br><br>

                        <b>VII. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</b><br>

                        As part of the Service, we may provide links to or compatibility with other websites or
                        applications. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those
                        websites or the information or content they contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to
                        information collected by us through the Service. Therefore, this Privacy Policy does not
                        apply to your use of a third-party website accessed by selecting a link via our Service. To
                        the extent that you access or use the Service through or on another website or application,
                        then the privacy policy of that other website or application will apply to your access or
                        use of that site or application. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of
                        other websites before proceeding to use them.<br><br>

                        <b>VIII. AGE OF CONSENT</b><br>

                        By using the Service, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age.<br><br>

                        <b>IX. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</b><br>

                        The Company reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any
                        time. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post these changes on this page
                        so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what
                        circumstances we disclose it. Any such modifications become effective upon your continued
                        access to and/or use of the Service five (5) days after we first post the changes on the
                        website or otherwise provide you with notice of such modifications. It is your sole
                        responsibility to check this website from time to time to view any such changes to the
                        terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to any changes, if and when such changes
                        may be made to this Privacy Policy, you must cease access to this website. If you have
                        provided your email address to us, you give us permission to email you for the purpose of
                        notification as described in this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

                        <b>X. MERGER OR ACQUISITION</b><br>

                        In the event we (or Weebly) undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by
                        another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may
                        be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur
                        and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our (or Weebly’s) assets
                        may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If
                        our information practices change at any time in the future, we will post the policy changes
                        here so that you may opt out of the new information practices. We suggest that you check
                        this Privacy Policy periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.<br><br>

                        <b>XI. EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS & OPTING OUT</b><br>

                        We will send you Service-related announcements on occasions when it is necessary to do so.
                        For instance, if our Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, or a new enhancement
                        is released, which will affect the way you use our Service, we might send you an email.
                        Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in
                        nature. Based upon the Personal Information that you provide us, we may communicate with
                        you in response to your inquiries to provide the services you request and to manage your
                        account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your
                        wishes. We may also use your Personal Information to send you updates and other promotional
                        communications. If you no longer wish to receive those email updates, you may opt-out of
                        receiving them by following the instructions included in each update or communication.<br><br>

                        <b>XII. CONTACT US & WITHDRAWING CONSENT</b><br>

                        If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or the practices of this Site, or
